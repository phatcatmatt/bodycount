# deaths-per-minute

This app uses a set of data from moviebodycounts.com and displays data about the films using D3.

Users can view data for over 500 movies, including the total number of "on-screen deaths". The user can add add and remove movies from their list to compare them and see data about the list.

Using the number of on-screen deaths and the total running time it calculates what is considered to be the *Pièce De Résistance*: Deaths per Minute (__DPM__) for each film, as well as an average DPM for the users list.

The 'My Data' section shows totals for the user's list as well as two charts.

-The bar graph shows the DPM for each film in a user's list, and the color changes to red to indicate that a film has a DPM greater than 1.

-The pie chart shows the total of deaths for a user's list, broken down by each film.

May this aid you in your quest to watch the most violent movies.
